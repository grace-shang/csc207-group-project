CSC207 Week 3 Project

Description of the Problem Domain: 

The problem domain that we have chosen for this project is the Time Management System/ Scheduling domain. We would like to develop a highly functional and easily accessible personal helper that betters an individual's life by creating a manageable workflow within their schedules, but also to help them plan their tasks and reminders throughout their daily lives. As such the problem domain would expand towards accessability for all individuals creating an application that everyone can enjoy.


Description of the Application:

It is the creation of a personal planner that is linked towards studies and the University of Toronto timetable. It will allow people to input their school schedules, list their tasks, list things they want as reminders, and other things on along that line. It allows students to keep all their schooling information on one software and ensure they are completing everything they need to. The application is going to let students be the best students they can be. 



API's We Can Use: 

Todo List API where we can add, delete, write, and read items on the Todo list. We can try to connect this to our software in order to optimize the personal helper asepct of our application and add it to the timetable if possible. This API would also allow us to keep track of the users on our software and how to manage all the users along with adding them, deleting the user profile from the app, and more along those lines as well.

Google Calendar API could be something we use to create the calendar and handle reminders along with it. It reads and updates calendars where we can try to connect it to our application so our users can view and create new events to input into their calendar.

Screenshot Using A Tool to Try the API:

With this image, on the left it showcases all the functions/helpers of the TODO list API that will help us create our program. It has a helper that will help us manage the user profiles with the following functions: creates users, login users, logs them out of the software, updates a user profile, uploads an image, gets a user image, deletes the image and deletes the user. It also will also implement our applications TODO feature as the API has a function to add a task, get all the tasks, get task by id, get task by completion, get task by pagnation, update task by id, and delete task by id. On the top right side of the screenshot I am see what it would look like to represent a user. It shows the body of the register user and at the bottom right side of the screen there is the code of the API.

I set up the TODO list API in Postman and uploaded all the functions following their procedure. Everything is now open and where I am going to work with the API.

CSC207 Week 3 Project

Description of the Problem Domain: 

Our groups problem domain would fall under the Time Management System/ Scheduling domain, though it would be more than that. The problem domain would also be a personal helper that works to better and make a person's life more manageable not only with helping them manage their schedules, but to also help them plan their tasks and reminders to help them in their daily lives. 


Description of the Application:

It is the creation of a personal planner that is linked towards studies and the University of Toronto timetable. It will allow people to input their school schedules, list their tasks, list things they want as reminders, and other things on along that line. It allows students to keep all their schooling information on one software and ensure they are completing everything they need to. The application is going to let students be the best students they can be.
